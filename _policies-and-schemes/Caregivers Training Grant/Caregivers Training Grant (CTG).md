Introduction To Caregivers Training Grant (CTG)  

--------------------------------------------------

You may wish to sign up for caregiving courses to learn how to better help your loved ones with their daily care. 

  

The Caregivers Training Grant is a $200 annual subsidy that lets caregivers attend approved courses to better care for their loved ones. The $200 subsidy is provided for each care recipient every financial year (from April to March the following year). If multiple caregivers of the same care recipient wish to attend training, the $200 would need to be shared among the family members.   

  

The list of courses available under the Caregivers Training Grant can be found on the [Caregiver Training Courses e-calendar](https://www.aic.sg/caregiving/caregiver-training-course). The trainer could conduct the class in your home, or in a classroom at a training centre. You can also use a computer or other electronic devices to learn, by watching videos and reading training materials.   
You must pay at least $10 after registering.
