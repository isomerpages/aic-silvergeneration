Introduction To MediShield Life

--------------------------------------------------

If you or your loved one are staying in hospital for a while, or need treatment for serious illnesses, you can use MediShield Life.

MediShield Life is medical insurance that provides life-time coverage for all Singaporeans. Unlike the previous scheme, MediShield, you cannot opt out of MediShield Life.

The premiums for MediShield Life can be paid using Medisave funds or cash. The Government has also provided subsidies for lower- and middle-income Singaporeans, as well as for Pioneer Generation members. There are also subsidies for the first four years of MediShield Life, as people move from MediShield to MediShield Life.
