Introduction To Integrated Home And Day Care (IHDC) Packages

-----------------------------------------------------------

IHDC packages are comprehensive and personalised to support seniors with multiple care needs, to maintain their independence and quality of life in the community for as long as possible.

Seniors who need intensive care will have the flexibility to get a different combination of care services in their homes, at a nearby day-care centre, or both, depending on their needs. The care needs will be reviewed regularly to ensure the care caters to the changing needs of the seniors over time.  

With this seamless and holistic care package, frail seniors who might otherwise enter a nursing home are able to continue to live at home with their loved ones. Caregivers are also supported throughout the care journey.
