Introduction to CareShield Life  

----------------------------------

CareShield Life is a long-term care insurance scheme launched on 1 October 2020 which provides basic financial protection should an individual become severely disabled, especially during old age, and need care for a prolonged duration.

From 1 October 2020, all Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents, born in 1980 or later, will be automatically covered under CareShield Life from 1 October 2020, or when they turn 30, whichever is later.

From 6 November 2021, all Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents born in 1979 or earlier can choose to join CareShield Life, if they are not severely disabled. To make joining more convenient, Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents born between 1970 and 1979 (both inclusive) who are insured under ElderShield 400 scheme and are not severely disabled will be auto-enrolled onto CareShield Life from December 2021.
