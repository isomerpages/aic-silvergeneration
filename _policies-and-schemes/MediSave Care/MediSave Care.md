Introduction to MediSave Care  

--------------------------------

MediSave Care is a long-term care scheme that was launched on 1 October 2020. It allows Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents aged 30 and above who are severely disabled to make monthly cash withdrawals up to a total of $200 per month from their own and/or their spouse’s MediSave Accounts for their long-term care needs.
