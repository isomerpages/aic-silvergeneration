Introduction to Medical Escort and Transport

-------------------------------

The service provides transportation and/or someone to accompany clients to travel to and from their homes for medical appointments and treatments (for example, at hospitals, specialist outpatient clinics, or polyclinics). 

It is for those who need help to move around, and have no caregiver, or whose caregiver is unable to provide support because of their own health and physical condition.
