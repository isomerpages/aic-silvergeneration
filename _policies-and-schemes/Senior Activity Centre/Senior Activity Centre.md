Introduction to Senior Activity Centre

--------------------------------------

Senior Activity Centres can be found in the void decks of HDB rental blocks, where seniors living around the area are encouraged to participate in active ageing. These centres conduct activities such as karaoke, arts & craft and exercise sessions to keep the elderly engaged. They also act as a communal space for elderly to socialise with their peers, and find social support.
