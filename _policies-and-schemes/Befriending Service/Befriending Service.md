Introduction to Befriending Service and Neighbourhood Links

---------------------------------------

Seniors who live alone may also have to deal with disabilities or issues caused by old age. Volunteers from befriending services can help to take care of the emotional and psychological wellbeing of these old folks by helping them or listening to their problems.

Befriending services include Neighbourhood Links, which are a support network for the community and run by volunteers. Some of these Neighbourhood Links are hooked up to emergency alarms connected to seniorsâ€™ flats.
