Introduction to ElderShield  

------------------------------

ElderShield is a basic long-term care insurance scheme targeted at severe disability, especially during old age. When it was introduced in 2002 as ElderShield 300, it provided payouts of $300/month for up to 5 years upon severe disability. It was subsequently reviewed in 2007 to ElderShield 400, which provides better benefits of $400/month for up to 6 years.
