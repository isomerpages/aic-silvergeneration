 Introduction to the Home Caregiving Grant  

--------------------------------------------

The Home Caregiving Grant has replaced the Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) Grant from October 2019.Â 

The Home Caregiving Grant (HCG) is a $200 monthly cash payout to support your loved ones with at least permanent moderate disability, i.e. always require some assistance to perform three or more Activities of Daily Living (ADLs).

This grant can be used to defray the costs of caregiving expenses, such as the costs of eldercare and caregiver support services in the community, or hiring of a Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW).
