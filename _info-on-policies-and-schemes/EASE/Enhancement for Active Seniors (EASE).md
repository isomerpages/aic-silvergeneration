Introduction to Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE)  

--------------------------------------------------------

Falls are common causes of elderly injuries at home. To help you or your loved one to move around safely at home, consider installing special tools around the house can help prevent falls.

The Housing and Development Board introduced Enhancement for Active Seniors in 2012, to subsidise home modifications so that older residents can live at ease in their own homes.

This is what you can install in your flat through the EASE programme:

*   Slip-resistant treatment to floor tiles in up to two bathrooms or toilets
*   Grab bars in the flat (eight or 10 grab bars for the first toilet, and six grab bars for the second toilet)
*   Up to five ramps in the flat, and/or at the main entrance – if it is doable
