------------------------------------------

Established in 2001, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) is a government organisation committed to promoting healthy living in Singapore. HPB is a credible and authoritative source of evidence-based health information that seeks to empower the Singapore public with knowledge and skills to take ownership of their health and live a healthy lifestyle. HPB, in turn, is guided by evidence-based health knowledge to formulate and implement health policies and programmes that will improve the nationâ€™s health.
