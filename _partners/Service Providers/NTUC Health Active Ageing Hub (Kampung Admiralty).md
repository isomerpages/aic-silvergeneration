-------------------------------------------

Building on more than four decades of experience and expertise, NTUC Health is among the largest senior day care, nursing home and home personal care providers in Singapore. NTUC Helalth also offers other services for seniors such as fitness classes and elderly gyms, and community support for vulnerable seniors. In addition, NTUC Health runs a chain of dental clinics, a family medicine clinic.

The Community Befriending Programme (CPB) is an initiative by the Ministry of Health. NTUC Health operates the CBP in the following 11 constituencies: Ayer Rajah, Bukit Batok, Henderson-Dawson, Jurong Central, Jurong Spring, Lengkok Bahru, Marsiling-Woodlands-Admiralty, Nanyang, Radin Mas, Taman Jurong and Whampoa. Community Befrienders visit vulnerable seniors regularly at their homes, taking note of their needs so that referrals can be directed to relevant support agencies where necessary.
