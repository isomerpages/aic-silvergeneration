---------------------------------------

Lions District Project. LB's mission is to provide friendship and care for seniors to age in place with community participation, enabling them to enjoy meaningful enriching lives.

LB Befriending Service reaches out to seniors who are at risk of social isolation. Through weekly home visits, trained befrienders (volunteers) provide social and psycho-emotional support to befriendees (seniors) whilst monitoring their welfare and living environment. The aim is to help seniors age in place within the community, relieve loneliness and improve their well-being.
