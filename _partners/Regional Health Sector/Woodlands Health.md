Member of the National Healthcare Group (NHG), Woodlands Health (WH) provides care for the North-Western population in Singapore. WH will operate a purpose-designed integrated Campus set to open progressively from end 2023. The Campus will include a fully integrated acute and community hospital, specialist outpatient clinics, a long-term care facility and green healing spaces.

Since 2016, WH has started serving and empowering residents in their health journey through our Community Nurse Posts and outreach efforts. WH also introduced initiatives to help improve the right-siting and accessibility of care within the community, such as the GPFirst Programme in the North, the first community-based Urgent Care Centre at Kampung Admiralty and the NurseFirst helpline.
